# New York Times Sudoku to Sudoku Exchange

I like to play the New York Times sudoku every day, but the NYT player is not great. Use this tool to scrap the sudoku out of NYT and open up a browser window to Sudoku Exchange.

## To Use
Clone or download this repo and `npm install` and `npm link`. `nyt-to-se` will be available on your command line. The default command opens the NYT easy puzzle.

### Options
Add one of these as the difficulty argument (--difficulty, -d) to open the specific puzzle.
* easy
* medium
* hard

**Example:** `nyt-to-se -d hard`
